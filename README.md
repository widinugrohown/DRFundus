# Diabetic Retinopathy Classification

This project focuses on classifying Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) based on fundus images using an EfficientNet model. The model achieves an accuracy of **74%** for classifying DR into 5 classes.

## Project Overview

Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a complication of diabetes that affects the eyes. Itâ€™s caused by damage to the blood vessels of the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (retina). Early detection through fundus images is crucial to managing and treating this condition effectively.

This project utilizes an EfficientNet model to classify fundus images into 5 different classes of Diabetic Retinopathy:

1. No DR
2. Mild DR
3. Moderate DR
4. Severe DR
5. Proliferative DR

## Model and Accuracy

The model used in this project is based on **EfficientNet**, a family of convolutional neural networks that efficiently scales up in both depth and width. It provides a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency.

- **Model**: EfficientNet
- **Accuracy**: 74% on the test set

## Web Interface

To make the model accessible, a simple web interface was created. Users can upload a fundus image, and the model will predict the stage of Diabetic Retinopathy.
